Initially started this with React Slingshot then stripped out the example to start building my own boilerplate for React + Node projects with so that
there is a true Node api platform backing the React webapp.   This is a work in progress.

The end goal is to have a legit visual analytics dashboard with geo using OpenLayers for information that I'm interested in.
